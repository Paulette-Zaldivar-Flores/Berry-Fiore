        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>
          Hi my name is Yesenia and I am the owner of Berry Fiore. I founded
          Berry Fiore in November 2020 when the pandemic hit. I am a stay at
          home mom who struggled with unemployment during the pandemic. I wanted
          to continue contributing to my house hold. With the help of my husband
          and loved ones we were able to establish Berry Fiore and now have over
          1,500 followers in Instagram and regular clients.
        </p>

          My passion for dipping strawberries began I would offer to help my
          in-laws with making traditional Valentines Day desserts for our yearly
          Valentines Day dinner. As I served and observed my in-laws enjoy the
          desserts I helped make that I would love to spread this joy to others.
          So I decided to make it a career by first sharing my desserts in small
          community events. This helped spread the joy of Berry Fiore all over
          the South San Diego Community.
